This is a thorough Visual Studio WPF project for an ATM GUI application. Through account selection, balance checks, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction histories, it will replicate an ATM. Three main classes will make up the application's structure: Bank, AtmApplication, and Account. Basic account activities and properties, such as balance and transactions, will be managed by the Account class. The Bank class is responsible for managing the list of accounts and executing the logic needed to obtain them. User interaction is the responsibility of class AtmApplication. It will evaluate user input and provide menus to the user. Ten default accounts with an initial balance of 100 will be included when the application is first launched. The user has the ability to create new accounts. The GUI interface facilitates all interactions and processes in a highly user-friendly manner.
